        "I am currently a first-year student at university, and I have been
        studying frontend development for the past 7 months. During this time, I
        have gained experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, SASS,
        JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, and Next.js. These technologies
        have allowed me to develop strong skills in building websites and
        creating user interfaces. My passion for web development continues to
        grow as I explore new frameworks and libraries. I am focused on building
        user-friendly and responsive websites. I enjoy problem-solving and
        collaborating with others to bring creative ideas to life. I am eager to
        expand my knowledge and pursue a career in frontend development."
